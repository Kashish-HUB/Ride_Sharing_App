The ride-sharing app I built in Android Studio using Kotlin and XML is a user-friendly platform designed to make commuting easier, faster, and more efficient. The app allows users to book rides seamlessly, offering a streamlined and intuitive interface for riders. Built with modern design principles, the app ensures a responsive and visually appealing layout, enhancing user engagement. Features such as real-time ride requests and cost estimation make the app highly practical and reliable for everyday use. 

For the front-end, I used XML to create a clean and structured user interface, incorporating components like RecyclerViews for ride history, custom buttons for navigation, and input fields for location search. Kotlin, with its concise syntax and powerful features, served as the backbone for implementing the appâ€™s functionality.

Additionally, the app is built with scalability in mind, ensuring that new features like ride-sharing for multiple passengers or electric vehicle options can be added in the future. 

With a focus on efficient coding practices and modular design, this app reflects a practical and innovative solution for modern transportation challenges.
