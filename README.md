# Ride_Sharing_App
A ride sharing app in which i have used Kotlin and XML in Android Studio Platform. It is totally front-end-based app. I have used technologies like splash screen, OSMDroid Mapview for easily accesibility of location for the user.  I also added ride choices which is based on the budget of the customer.
